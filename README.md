A little space shooter game made with [pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel).

![banner](branding/banner-960x320.png)

Originally inspired by the [«Defenders of the weeping Quasar»](https://ianmaclarty.itch.io/defenders) of Ian MacLarty, this game has evolved into its own destiny. For the moment only two levels are available ... But will you be able to defend the planet earth until the very end ? Remember, you are humanity's last hope...
